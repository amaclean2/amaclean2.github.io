<div class="focus">A Guide on the Prime Problem</div>

Did you get it to work? <br>
Here's how to think about it if you didn't.<br><br>
A prime number is a number that is only divisible by one and itself, so we need to check some numbers below it to see if it's divisble by them. <br>
For now, let's check everything greater than 1, because if it's divisble by 1 then it still could be prime. <br>
We need to loop through every number 2 to one less than our number to see if it's divisble. <br>
Now we're in our loop and we need to test if our number is divisble by our iteration <br>
An if-statement can tell us to spit out false if our number is divisble otherwise keep going through the loop if it isn't. <br>
Now, you just have to figure out what goes in the conditions of the if-statement.
