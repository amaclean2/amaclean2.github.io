Computers mainly do one of two things, they assign data to memory and they can compare two different pieces of data.<br />
An if-statement is a conditional statement that depends on what the result of a comparison is.<br />
Above we have <code>if term < 2 :</code><br />
The way an if-statement is organized is<br />
<div class="code-block">if {conditions}
	do something
else
	do something else
</div><br />
<code>term</code> is the value passed from the function parameters in <code>def fibonacci(term) :</code> and we are looking to see if it is 0 or 1.<br />
If it is then do the steps immediately underneath, otherwise skip it all together or if there is an else conditions then execute that.<br />
