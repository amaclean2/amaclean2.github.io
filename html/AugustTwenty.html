When you think of how long a program runs, you would normally think in seconds, right? <br>
It seems like a meaningful amount of time, but the problem is, different computers take different amounts of time to complete the same instructions. <br>
Some computers might have multiple proceses running at the same time and so can't allocate as much processing power to a given program or some just don't have as much power to begin with. <br>
So, we measure the amount of time a program takes to run in steps. <br>
We count these steps in a format called O-notation. <br>
For instance, a while-loop that loops an 'n' amount of times would run in O(n) steps. <br>
A variable declaration that sets <code>count</code> equal to zero would run in O(1) steps. <br>
A loop inside a loop would be O(n<sup>2</sup>) and so on. <br><br>
O(n) or even O(n<sup>2</sup>) wouldn't seem like a big deal when you're looping through five entities, but when you're looping millions or even billions of times, it will take more time than you feel like waiting if your computer doesn't outright crash. <br>
Then, there's a strong urge to make programs run in as few steps as possible, which is what we're going to look at on our Primes program.
