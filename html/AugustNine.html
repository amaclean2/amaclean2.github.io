We saw a lot of new code yesterday, let's go over it.<br />
<code>def fibonacci(term) :</code><br />
The <code>def</code> keyword specifies that you are defining a function and this code will belong in a seperate block.<br />
<code>fibonacci(term)</code> is the name of your function and the parameters passed to it. <br />
In this case you are passing one parameter called term.<br />
Parameters are the input that you give to the function to do something with and then return a result.<br />
Lastly, <code>:</code> is what defines the start of the scope of the function. We'll talk more about scope later.<br />
All the code defined in the fibonacci function is tabbed over one tab.<br />
Normally this is just good syntax, but Python uses tabs to denote scoping of the code.<br />
This just means that it's important if you want some code to run in the function than it has to have the correct tabs.<br />
