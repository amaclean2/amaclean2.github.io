<div class="focus">Loops</div>
There's a bunch of these, but we'll start with something simple <br>
<div class="center-this">
	<div class="code-block">i = 0
while i < 10 :
	print i
	i += 1
	</div>
</div>
<code>i</code> is a variable that will hold our index while we loop <br>
Our loop says that while the value at i is less than 10 we will keep repeating the code beneath it <br>
The code beneath will print the value of i and then increment i by one <br>
<code>i += 1</code> is shorthand for i = i + 1, which takes the value of i adds 1 to it and then reassigns it to i <br>
Then you repeat the whole process
