<div class="focus">Let's Learn Python</div>
In your ExerciseOne.py file it should say <code>print "Hello World"</code><br />
<code>print</code> is a function that outputs on the screen most anything you give it.<br />
A function is a block of code that acts as a black box.<br />
It takes some parameters in, does something to them and then spits out a response.<br />
In this case the <code>print</code> function took in the parameter "Hello World" and showed it to you on the screen.<br /><br />
<code>"Hello World"</code> is a string. 
Each character in Hello World is called a character, and all of them put together is called a string. Also, most of the time you write a string surrounded in double quotes (""), that's how the computer knows it's a string.
Almost all programming languages will use the concept of characters and strings, so they're a good thing to learn.<br />
<div class="center-this">Here are some examples of strings<br />
<code>"Hello World"</code><br />
<code>"Pineapples"</code><br />
<code>"Tell me if this program ran correctly"</code><br /></div>
