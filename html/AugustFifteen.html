<div class="focus">Return values</div>

A function is a block of code that you can refer to at some point later in your program <br>
We illustrated it before as a sort of black box where you give it an input and it does something with it <br>
The return value is what the function gives back when it's done <br>
Lets write something
<div class="center-this">
	<div class="code-block">def squareThis(term) :
	return term * term

myTerm = 2
mySquare = squareThis(myTerm)

print mySquare
	</div>
</div>

Notice how <code>return term * term</code> is tabbed over one tab. This means it's scoped inside the squareThis function. <br>
We assigned the variable <code>mySquare</code> to the return value of <code>squareThis(myTerm)</code> which should give us 4. <br>
Try it yourself.
