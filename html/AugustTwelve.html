<code>myArr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]</code>
We went over these a little while ago, but here's a refresher <br>
An array is a collection of values that are all associated with each other, they can be strings or numbers or objects or even more arrays <br>
You can get the item at any given index just by calling the array and then in brackets the index <br>
<code>myArr[3]</code> would be 2<br>
