A variable assigns a value to a portion of memory on your computer.<br />
When we say a = 2 we are taking some location in memory and telling the computer to use that everytime we call the variable <code>a</code><br />
Then we assign the value 2 to that location in memory<br />
In the if-statement we compare the value at the location in memory, a, to 3 and if it's less then we execute the following code<br />
Some varible examples:<br />
<code>a = 15</code><br />
<code>a = "Please enter some more text"</code><br />
<code>a = 12 - 2</code><br />
<code>a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code><br /><br />
