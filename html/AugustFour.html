An array is a data object to group a list of emements. <br />
Each item in an array is called an element.	<br />
In programming you count elements starting from 0, so '5' would be the 0-th element, '4' the first and so on.<br />
You access this by calling newArr[0]. <br />
<code>let element = newArr[3]; // 2</code>
