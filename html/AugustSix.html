<div class="focus">Writing your first program</div><br />
In the Sublime window you opened write <code>print "Hello World"</code><br />
Save the file and in the terminal window type in <code>cd ~/Desktop/TheLessonBox</code><br />
In the terminal type <code>python ExerciseOne.py</code>

Sublime is a text editor, a very smart one. It can finish your sentence, suggest variable names and format lots of kinds of computer programs.<br /><br />
Terminal is a command prompt, it's like how you would use your computer if you didn't have a mouse. Everything you do on your computer, can be carried out by a command in Terminal. You can run programs, start applications, open and close folders, and compile different styles of code.<br /><br />
So far we've mainly been using Terminal to navigate between different directories. The folders that you see on your screen are called directories in programming. A directory is a section of the computer's memory where it knows to look for those files.<br /><br />
When you typed in <code>python</code> and then a program name, your computer knew to use the Python compiler to run the program you gave it. We'll talk more about Python tomorrow
