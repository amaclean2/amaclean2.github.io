<div class="focus">Fixing our Function</div>
Yesterday we talked about making programs run in as few steps as possible and now we're going to apply that to our Primes function. <br>
Right now the function loops through every element less that our parameter <code>test</code>, but we only need the first half of those since the last have would only contain multiples of the first half. <br>
We can make it look like this
<div class="center-this">
	<div class="code-block">def isPrime(test) :
	i = 2
	half = test / 2
	while i < half :
		if test % i < 1 :
			return False
		i += 1
	return True
	</div>
</div>
This now makes it run in half the time it did before. That's a good start. <br>
Now, there's some other shortcuts we can make. Look at this <br>
<div class="center-this">
	<div class="code-block">def isPrime(test) :
	i = 3
	half = test / 2

	if test % 2 < 1 :
		return False

	while i < half :
		if test % i < 1 :
			return False
		i += 2
	return True
	</div>
</div>
Now we're only testing a quarter of the values we were testing before. <br>
Can you think of other ways to make it run better?
