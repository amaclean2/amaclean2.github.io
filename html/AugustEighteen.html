<div class="focus">Did you get it yet?</div>

So, in most programming languages, there's a modular function that tells you what the remainder of one number divided by another number is. <br>
<div class="center-this">
	<code>8 % 2</code> equals 0 <br>
	<code>7 % 3</code> equals 1	<br>
	<code>8 % 3</code> equals 2
</div>
Modular arithmatec is doing math on numbers based on another number. <br>
Wait a minute, it'll make more sense. <br>
So, if we're doing math modulo 5, then all of our results can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. <br>
15 minus 3 would be 2 modulo 5, since 15 minus 3 is 12 which is 2 more than a number 0 modulo 5 <br>
10 would be 0 modulo 5 <br>
11 would be 1 modulo 5 <br>
27 would be 2 modulo 5 and so on<br>
In programming we can find out what a number modulo another number is by using the percent sign. <br>
So <code>27 % 5</code> would be 2.
